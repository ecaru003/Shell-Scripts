# ecaru003Bash_Scripts

This is a collection of Bash scripts which I have either written before, find interesting, or find userful

UNIX (Bash)
    GenerateCustomHomeFolders.sh
        Given a properly formatted CSV (ecaru003.csv), script generated a thousand user folders based on given requirements. 
        /home/ was organized by two subfolders, "olympic" and "paralympic"
        
        Olympic was further organized by competitive sport, and finally each individual username.
        Each olympic user's personal home folder needed to have three files ('country' 'event' 'medal' with respective CSV entries within.
        
        Paralympic users were treated similarly, but organized by home country instead of competitive sport.
        
    GenerateWebpageByGender.sh

Windows (PowerShell)
